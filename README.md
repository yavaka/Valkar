# Valkar - driver management system

## Project Description
Valkar is a web-based application, driver management system that helps managers, owners and other team members of logistics companies to track activities by every driver. Drivers will be able to record their shifts which includes signing and sending the required documentation to their manager for completed deliveries. On the other hand, the manager/owner is able to see all onboard drivers\` profiles. These profiles consist of personal details, completed deliveries, filled documents with the option to be exported into PDF files and calendar showing the shifts of a particular driver.
